The search bar is non functional. Sorry :')

I attempted to use the newest next13 with this and kept running into errors when rendering some of my async server components (notably: "Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object Promise]). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead."). I spent a lot of time trying different ways of implementing a search (tried filtering results, api calls, making all components into client components) I feel I was close but ultimately I was defeated this time.

I have left the code in "PokemonList" but have commented it out in case you want to look at it.

Sadly this meant I couldnt spend much time on styling and extra functionality, but I learned a lot and had fun making it!
